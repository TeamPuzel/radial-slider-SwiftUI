# radial-slider-SwiftUI
This is not a 100% finished project yet but the buttons and toggle work perfectly.
The slider is a bit unfinished, and doesn't update the UI.

The code and large toggle design are *not* licensed for use.
The rest of the UI is based on Apple's Sleep Schedule (like the slider itself)
