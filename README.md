# radial-slider-SwiftUI
This is not a 100% finished project but but the buttons and toggle work perfectly.
The slider is a bit unfinished, and doesn't update the UI (Until the slider is finalized, there's no point in writing a function to convert the angle to the time, since it will break on changes anyway)

The code and large toggle design are *not* licensed for use.
The rest of the UI is based on Apple's Sleep Schedule (like the slider itself)
You can use my toggle if your project is open source though :)
